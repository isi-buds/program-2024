### Background
The oldest-old (people aged 90 and older) are the fastest-growing segment of the population in the US and many other countries around the world. Given that age is the strongest risk factor for the development of dementia, the oldest-old have the highest rates of dementia. Given these trends, dementia is expected to become a large public health problem. By the middle of the century in the US, we are expected to have more people with dementia among the oldest-old than we currently have at all ages combined. Therefore, identifying the relationships between modifiable factors and dementia is important to mitigate its impact in the oldest-old population. Many studies have shown that hypertension (high blood pressure) during midlife is associated with an increased risk of developing dementia later in life. Some studies, however, suggest that this association may vary by age. For instance, in The 90+ Study, a study of people aged 90 and older, we found that those with a history of hypertension had a decreased risk of dementia when compared to those who never developed hypertension. Several potential explanations for this inverse association in the oldest-old have been proposed including the possibility that a higher blood pressure may be necessary to maintain adequate blood flow to the brain, the use of antihypertensive medications that may lower the risk of dementia, reverse causality, or selection bias.     
 
### Study Design and Data Description
The 90+ Study is a community-based longitudinal study of aging and dementia in people 90 and older that began in 2003 and has enrolled >2000 individuals. Participants were initially part of the Leisure World Cohort Study (LWCS), a study of residents of a retirement community in Orange County, California in the early 1980s. Survivors from the LWCS who were 90 and older and alive on or after 1/1/2003 were invited to participate in The 90+ Study. Participants in The 90+ Study are evaluated every 6 months until death. 559 participants who were dementia-free at the time of enrollment in The 90+ Study are included in this project. Data include demographic variables (age, sex, education), the presence or absence of hypertension at baseline, diagnosis of dementia, additional medical history variables, systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements, use of antihypertensive medications, and lifestyle and health variables from the time of the LWCS (physical activity, body mass index, vitamin intake, and sleep duration).
 
### Objectives
The goal of this project is to investigate the relationship between hypertension and dementia in a cohort of the oldest-old individuals, and to explore potential explanations for the seemingly paradoxical association. For example, is it because people with hypertension are more likely to die before they develop dementia? Is the protective effect of hypertension attributable to the antihypertensive medications? Are there differences in the people who do and do not develop hypertension that could explain the association? We will explore topics such as bias due to censoring (death or drop-out), bias due to confounding (systematic differences between those who developed hypertension and those who did not), and longitudinal changes in blood pressure. Analytical strategies may include logistic regression, survival analysis, propensity score-based causal methods, and longitudinal data models. The project will follow a stepwise approach, where questions will be addressed sequentially, with increasingly complex methods applied at each step.

## Environmental Predictors of Scrub and Murine Typhus in Lao PDR (2003 – 2017)

### Mentoring Team

- Volodymyr Minin, Professor of Statistics, UCI
- Isaac Goldstein, Statistics PhD Student, UCI

### Background
Scrub typhus (Orientia tsutsugamushi) and murine typhus (Rickettsia typhi) are significant public health concerns in Lao PDR and elsewhere. Scrub typhus is considered a rural disease spread by Leptotrombidium spp., while murine typhus is an urban disease spread by Xenopsylla cheopis. A previous study on these diseases in Lao PDR, using patient data from 2003 to 2017, found that most scrub typhus cases occurred during the later part of the rainy season (July-September), that patients with scrub typhus were more likely to come from villages with higher levels of surface flooding and vegetation prior to diagnosis, and that scrub typhus patients were dispersed and farther away from major roads and urban centers while murine typhus cases were concentrated closer to the city center and along the Mekong River. Much about the ecology of these diseases remains unknown because they are poorly studied, especially in low income nations. They are rarely studied in unison. 


### Study Design and Data
The data include patient age and gender, clinical symptoms (headache, fever, myalgia), test results for scrub and murine typhus, and home village location. Environmental data for home villages include relative vegetation and surface water levels (drawn from a 5km buffer around home villages and at different time intervals), elevation, and proximity to major roads and the national capital. It may be possible to pull more environmental data (i.e. earth observation data) if there is interest. 


### Objectives
1. Assess how individual-level factors modify the impact of environmental predictors on infection rates.
2. Identify environmental predictors of co-infection with scrub and murine typhus.

Teams can also propose other study objectives

## Background 
The burden of HIV in Ukraine is one of the highest in Europe; at the end of 2021 there were an estimated 245,000 people living with HIV (PLWH) in Ukraine, with HIV prevalence amongst adults at 0.66%. While the annual number of new cases stabilized in Ukraine in 2012, efforts to contain the HIV epidemic in the country were threatened by the beginning of the war in 2014 and the escalation of the war to a full-scale invasion by Russia in 2022, accompanied by unprecedented since the World War II population displacement in Europe. 3.7 million internally displaced people (IDP) were registered in Ukraine as of September 25th, 2023, often facing large burdens of non-communicable and infectious diseases as well as mental health issues. In 2022, the HIV diagnosis rate in 2022 was 29.8 per 100,000, the second highest in Europe. 
Men who have sex with men (MSM), often experience higher prevalence of HIV and their access to HIV treatment and prevention in Eastern Europe can be complicated by widespread stigma of same-sex relationships. With HIV prevalence estimated at 3.9%, and HIV risk 26 times higher than that of heterosexual men, MSM are the only key population in Ukraine with a projected rise in new HIV cases. 

## Study Design and Data Description
We will use data in a bio-behavior survey conducted by the Alliance for Public Health, a Ukrainian non-government organization combating HIV and other diseases in key populations. Participants were surveyed between August 2023 and January 2024 across 8 cities in Ukraine via respondent-driven sampling (RDS), a non-probability sampling technique often used in key populations. The bio-behavioral survey collected information on demographics (gender identity, marital status, education, occupation, place of residence, income in past 30 days), migration, narcotic substance use, sexual behavior, mental health, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), prior HIV testing and treatment experience, healthcare seeking experience, as well as stigma and discrimination. The biological testing component tested for HIV, HCV, HBV, syphilis, and TB. 

## Objectives 
The goal of the study is to investigate factors associated with negative mental health outcomes in MSM with and without history of displacement. While controlling for the geographic differences and differences in traumatic experiences, we will work on building a model that best describes the relationship between displacement and mental health in sexual minority men in a war setting.

### Description
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has become a world-wide healthcare crisis.  With the advancing age of world populations, the prevalence of AD is expected to increase dramatically over the next three decades, leading to enormous medical morbidity, family challenges, and healthcare costs.  AD is characterized by abnormal amyloid protein plaques in the brain, along with associated pathophysiological processes.  Memory impairment due to AD usually begins after age 70.

People with Down Syndrome are at very high risk of developing AD early in adulthood, due to the overexpression of amyloid precursor protein associated with triplication of chromosome 21.  Most with DS will have amyloid plaques of AD in the brain by age 40 and progressive cognitive decline by age 50.  

Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) such as depression, anxiety, irritability, apathy, and agitation occur commonly in those with late-life onset AD (LOAD), usually later in the course of illness, and contribute to additional patient morbidity, caregiver stress, and institutionalization.  Recent evidence indicates that mild neuropsychiatric symptoms may occur early in the course of AD and even before memory decline is apparent.  The role of these NPS as an early expression of AD pathology or as an additional risk for developing AD dementia is not clear.  Those with AD due to Down Syndrome (DSAD) are at similar risk for early neuropsychiatric symptoms.  However, the pattern of NPS in DSAD is less clear and prior studies have not compared the pattern of NPS in DSAD and LOAD at different stages of illness.

Understanding the respective patterns of NPS in DSAD and LOAD, and their links to memory and other cognitive changes over time in the two groups can serve two important purposes:

1.  Clarify the role of NPS in AD pathophysiology.  People with early DSAD and LOAD share the presence of amyloid plaques in the brain, in generally the same locations and with similar progression over time.  However, DSAD differs from LOAD in several ways: those with DSAD have a “purer” form of AD with fewer mixed brain pathologies, commonly have obstructive sleep apnea and may develop epilepsy, have more extensive cortical amyloid angiopathy and microbleeds, and often have amyloid plaque in the basal ganglia, a subcortical region involved in both motor behavior and neuropsychiatric symptoms.  Thus, a similar pattern of NPS in the two groups suggests that these symptoms are related to the shared amyloid pathology, whereas different patterns would indicate that non-amyloid features are driving the expression of distinct NPS.
2.	Improve clinical care.  Understanding the specific NPS that occur in DSAD and LOAD can help patients, clinicians, and family members be aware of symptoms, beyond memory decline, that are related to the AD process and impact clinical course over time.  Such awareness helps distinguish these symptoms from traditional psychiatric disorders, improves differential diagnosis, and may reveal opportunities for better targeted treatments early in the illness course.  


### Objectives
1.	Identify and compare the pattern of NPS in two cohorts of participants: DSAD and LOAD, at three levels of cognitive impairment – cognitively stable/unimpaired, mild cognitive impairment, and mild AD dementia.
2.	Measure the longitudinal change in NPS over a three-year period in those with DSAD.  Assess the relationship between baseline NPS and the change in NPS over time and the change in cognitive skills over a similar period.
3.	(Optional) Evaluate the relationship between AD biomarkers (from amyloid and tau PET imaging) and NPS total symptoms and individual symptom clusters in those with DS who are cognitively stable or have mild cognitive impairment.

### Study Design and Data Description
Cross-sectional and longitudinal cohort measures of NPS and cognitive skills in DS and older adults.  The data is derived from the ABC-DS national cohort and the NACC national ADRC cohort.

- Primary variable in the DSAD and LOAD cohorts:  Neuropsychiatric Inventory (12 NPS items) 
- Other variables in the DSAD cohort: Reiss Maladaptive Behavior scale, Down Syndrome Mental Status Exam (cognition), amyloid PET SUVR, tau PET SUVR
Other variables in the LOAD cohort: Geriatric Depression Scale, MOCA (global cognition), Verbal recall assessment (memory)
- Covariates, as appropriate.
