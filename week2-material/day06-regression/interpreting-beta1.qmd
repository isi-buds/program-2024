# Linear model (Continuous response variable)

$$E[Y_i] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i$$

$\beta_1$ = difference in expected value of $Y$ associated with a 1 unit difference in $X$.

## Generalized linear model: Poisson (Discrete response variable)

$$log(E[Y_i]) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i$$

Note "Expected value" can be used interchangeably with "rate" with this model.

### Difference in log expected value

$$\beta_1$$

= difference in log expected value of $Y$ associated with a 1 unit difference $X$

OR

= (multiplicitive) change in log rate ratio of $Y$ associated with a 1 unit difference in $X$

### Multiplicative change in expected value

$$exp(\beta_1)$$

= (multiplicitive) change in rate ratio of $Y$ associated with a 1 unit difference in $X$

### Percent change in expected value

$$\text{For } exp(\beta_1) < 1: (1 - exp(\beta_1)) * 100\%$$

$$\text{For } exp(\beta_1) > 1: (exp(\beta_1) -1) * 100\%$$

= percent change in expected value of $Y$ associated with a 1 unit difference in $X$
